# MILO - Minimal Input Life Organizer

MILO aims to give users a private, local-first assistant. All core reasoning and data stay on the machine. New features are built as plugins so the core remains small and extensible.

## Goals
- **Local-first**: keep user data on device and run the AI locally.
- **Plugin-based architecture**: skills live in the `plugins/` directory and are discovered by the `PluginManager`.

## Development setup
Install dependencies with Poetry:

```bash
poetry install
```

Add a new dependency using:

```bash
poetry add <package_name>
```

## Adding plugins
Create a new file under `plugins/` with a class that subclasses `BaseSkill` and implements `execute`. When `PluginManager.discover_plugins()` runs, your skill will be loaded automatically.

## Testing and formatting
Run tests with:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

Format the codebase using:

```bash
poetry run ruff format .
```

Check linting with:

```bash
poetry run ruff check .
```
